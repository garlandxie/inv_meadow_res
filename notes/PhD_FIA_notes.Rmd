# Flow injection analysis

## Equipment Checklist

### Ammonia and nitrate

NOTE: Adriano said you can store extracts in the fridge (4C) for up to three weeks

1.  Preferable filter paper: Fisher Q2 (ashless), Whatman 42, Fisher P8. NOTE: there should be \~81 Fischer P8 papers from MacIvor + Cadotte lab supply.

2.  Potassium chloride (KCL). Try to maintain a 1:10 ratio of soil-extractant solution (e.g., 2g of fresh soil and 20 mL of KCL) --\> current stock: 1/2 full large bottle (n = 2), 1 full large bottle (n=1)

3.  250mL flasks. Check Marney's lab

4.  125mL volumetric flasks. Check Marney's lab.

5.  Shaker. Check Marney's lab.

6.  Funnels. Check Marney's lab.

7.  Storage bottles. Check Marney's lab.

8.  Tape. Took some from Scott's supplies

9.  Sharpies. Took some from Scott's supplies

### **Orphophosphates**

NOTE: Adriano said this should be done the day before FIA operations

1.  Preferable filter paper: Fisher P5. NOTE: there should be 100 Fischer P5 papers from MacIvor + Cadotte lab supply.
2.  Bray-1 solution. Current lab supply --\> 1 full bottle (n= 2, Vicoria June 2021)
3.  250mL flasks. Check Marney's lab.
4.  125mL volumetric flasks. Check Marney's lab.
5.  Shaker. Check Marney's lab.
6.  Funnels. Check Marney's lab.
7.  Storage bottles. Check Marney's lab.
8.  Tape. Took some from Scott's supplies
9.  Sharpies. Took some from Scott's supplies

### LECO

LECO Protocol (3-4 hours for prep)

1.  Oven-dried: 105 C for 24 hrs, 0.2 grams for each sample

2.  Ball has to be inside the holding unit with the \~5 grams of sample. Close the unit with the lid.

3.  Release the lock and place the holding unit within the clasp

4.  Make sure lid of the shaking machine is on

5.  Frequency: 20 per sec, 20 secs

6.  Place each sample in a little plastic tube (its near the shaking machine) - can get this straight from the holding unit

7.  Clean the holding unit with a Kim wipe, make sure there's no sediment left so take your time doing this

8.  Can place plastic tubes into colorful trays (its near the LECO machine)

9.  Oven dry the sample before LECO machine prep. Place it into an envelope, label it, and then oven dry it for 30 minutes (105 C).

10. Take an aluminum foil and place on top of a black holding unit. This material can be found in a drawer underneath the LECO machine.

11. Place aluminum foil + black holding unit and place it in the weighing scale. Tare it afterwards. 0.198-0.200 grams for range. Never exceed 0.2 grams!

12. Squeeze foil with 0.2 grams of sample with bare hands (no gloves). Try to squeeze out as much air as possible. Twist it so it looks like a hershey kisses.

13. Place the hershey kisses into the black holding unit. Weight it and record it onto a spreadsheet.

14. Place the hershey kisses into a black holding tray (labeled 1-10). Make sure you match the label with the plot ID!!!

**Ke's analysis**

FOR SURE:

-   LECO --\> Total C and N

-   FIA -\> 2g for orthophosphates

-   pH

MAYBE... (if she has time)

-   AA--\> cations
